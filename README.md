# Underscores-Bootstrap
Lean Wordpress starter theme combining _s with Bootstrap 4 framework, and including a ready to go child theme.

_s theme: https://underscores.me

Bootstrap 4: https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com

For mobile menu I have integrated the great Mmenu: http://mmenu.frebsite.nl

I have included Font Awesome by default as I find I use this in most sites nowadays.

Bootstrap & Font Awesome loaded via CDN as chances are user will have these already cached in their browser.

Also included is a plugin to use if using Gravity Forms, it adds relevant Bootstrap 4 code and styles to GF forms.
